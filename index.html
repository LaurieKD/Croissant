		<h1>Croissants</h1>
		<p>
			Croissants are a type of French pastry that are renowned for their delicate and buttery flavor. They are
			crescent-shaped and have a flaky texture that is achieved by rolling out and folding the dough multiple times.
			This process is known as lamination and it creates the signature layers of a croissant. <br />
			<br />The origins of the croissant are somewhat disputed, with some claiming that it was invented in Vienna and
			others insisting that it was a French creation. Regardless of its origin, croissants have become an integral part
			of French cuisine and culture. They are often enjoyed as a breakfast food and are perfect for dipping in a cup of
			coffee or tea. <br /><br />While plain croissants are delicious on their own, they can also be filled with a
			variety of sweet or savory fillings. For a sweet option, try a croissant filled with chocolate or almond paste.
			For something more savory, opt for a croissant filled with ham and cheese or spinach and feta. The possibilities
			are endless and there's a croissant filling for every taste!
